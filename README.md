# Spotify Web Scrape Analysis

This project aims to scrape data from Spotify's publicly available webpages (such as artist pages, album pages, and track listings) to analyze various features such as song popularity, artist information, album details, and more. The scraping is done using Python with BeautifulSoup (bs4) and requests libraries.

## Features

- Scrapes Spotify's website for artist, album, and track data.
- Extracts details like song titles, artists, album names, release dates, and popularity.
- Performs data analysis on the extracted information (e.g., average popularity of songs, most popular artists).
- Allows for export of the scraped data to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib` (for visualizing data)

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib
```

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-webscrape-analysis.git
   cd spotify-webscrape-analysis
   ```

2. **Scraping the Data**:
   
   - The main scraping script is `scrape_spotify.py`. You can customize this script to target specific Spotify pages (e.g., artists, albums).
   - Example usage for scraping an artist's page:
   
   ```python
   from scrape_spotify import scrape_artist_data
   
   artist_url = 'https://open.spotify.com/artist/{artist_id}'
   data = scrape_artist_data(artist_url)
   ```

3. **Analyzing the Data**:
   
   After scraping the data, you can analyze the results using the `analyze_data.py` script. This script will help you analyze and visualize the popularity of tracks or any other metrics youâ€™re interested in.

   Example usage:
   
   ```python
   from analyze_data import plot_popularity
   plot_popularity(data)
   ```

4. **Exporting the Data**:
   
   You can export the scraped data to a CSV file for further analysis using the `export_data.py` script:
   
   ```python
   from export_data import export_to_csv
   
   export_to_csv(data, 'spotify_data.csv')
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the scraping script to get the data:

   ```bash
   python scrape_spotify.py
   ```

2. Analyze the data:

   ```bash
   python analyze_data.py
   ```

3. Export the data to a CSV file:

   ```bash
   python export_data.py
   ```

## Notes

- The scraping script only works for publicly available Spotify data.
- Be aware of Spotifyâ€™s scraping policies and terms of service when using this script.
- You can modify the scraping logic to extract more detailed data depending on your needs.
